Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. If you have issues with the APIs or have a question about the Watson services, see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-watson+node.js).

 Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

**Check service status**

1.  For service issues or 5xx errors, first, go to the [IBM Cloud status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?component=compare-comply%2Cdiscovery%2Cconversation%2Cwatson-vision-combined%2Cnatural-language-understanding%2Cnatural-language-classifier%2Clanguage-translator%2Cpersonality-insights%2Cspeech-to-text%2Ctext-to-speech%2Ctone-analyzer&selected=status) and check the status of the service.
1.  If the service status is OK, continue with a bug report.
